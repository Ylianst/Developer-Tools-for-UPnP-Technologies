The Developer Tools for UPnP™ Technologies is a set of development and reference tools for creating software that is compatible with the UPnP specifications. These tools includes generic devices and control points, stack generation tools and UPnP AV debug and reference tools. Most of the tools are written in C# but small C/C++ stack can also be generated.
 
These tools are not by themselves compliant with the UPnP specification since they have never been on their own tested to pass the tests of the UPnP Forum. While there is no guaranty, these tools should be helpful to developers and testers building solutions that are compatible or can be certified to be UPnP compliant. In all, there are over 10 tools in this package that range from low-level debugging to full reference tools.

The UPnP Forum publishes all the specifications around UPnP. They publish device description documents and have a certification program. If you are building a UPnP device or software, consider joining the forum.
